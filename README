## Format
Data are formatted according to BIDS version 1.9.9

## Single pulse stimulation
The patient were resting in the hospital bed, while single pulse stimulation was performed with a frequency of ~0.2 Hz. The stimulation had a duration of 200 microseconds, was biphasic and had an amplitude of 6mA.
